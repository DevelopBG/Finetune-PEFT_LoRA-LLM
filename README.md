ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project fine-tunes a Large Language Model (LLM) using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for sentiment analysis.
The model is trained to classify movie reviews (positive, negative, neutral), showcasing how lightweight fine-tuning can achieve strong performance with limited compute and memory.

ðŸš€ Features

  - Fine-tuning a pre-trained LLM using LoRA
  - Sentiment classification: Positive, Negative, Neutral
  - Efficient training with <1% trainable parameters
  - Training implemented in Google Colab for reproducibility
  - Supports inference with Hugging Face Transformers
